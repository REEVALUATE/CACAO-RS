Section	Action	URI	Applicable	Reasoning
Permissions	accept tracking	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/acceptTracking	NO	The license does not explicitly grant permission to accept tracking. This action is usually a choice by the user of a service, not a right granted by a content license.
Permissions	aggregate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/aggregate	YES	The license allows building upon the material, which includes aggregating it with other works, provided attribution and other conditions are met.
