Section	Action	URI	Applicable	Reasoning
Permissions	accept tracking	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/acceptTracking	NO	The license does not explicitly grant permission to accept tracking. This action is usually a choice by the user of a service, not a right granted by a content license.
Permissions	aggregate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/aggregate	YES	The license allows building upon the material, which includes aggregating it with other works, provided attribution and other conditions are met.

Permissions	annotate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/annotate	YES	Annotating is a form of adaptation or modification. The license permits adapting the material (Section 2.a.1.B: produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material).
Permissions	anonymize	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/anonymize	NO	While one could technically anonymize data licensed under CC BY 4.0, the license itself doesn't grant this as a specific permission. The primary obligation is attribution, which is contrary to anonymization of authorship.

Permissions	attribution	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Attribution	YES	This is a core component and permission/condition of the license. The deed states Attribution — You must give appropriate credit. The act of using the work is permitted *if* attribution is given.
