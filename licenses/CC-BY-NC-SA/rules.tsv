Permissions	digitize	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/digitize	YES	If the material is in analog form the permission to 'reproduce' and 'adapt' in any 'medium or format' implies the right to digitize it to exercise other permitted rights.

Permissions	include	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/include	YES	The permission to 'Adapt — remix transform and build upon the material' implies the right to include the material (or parts of it) in a larger work (an Adaptation) under ShareAlike conditions.
Permissions	index	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/index	YES	Indexing for non-commercial discovery purposes can be seen as a use or a technical modification necessary to exercise licensed rights. It doesn't conflict with the license.
Permissions	inform	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/inform	NO	The license does not grant a specific right to 'inform' in the ODRL sense which usually refers to informing about events or data handling. However a user is permitted to inform others about the work by sharing it.

Permissions	sharing	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Sharing	YES	The license explicitly allows users to 'Share — copy and redistribute the material'.
Permissions	source code	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/sourceCode	NO	This specific ODRL action means to make the source code of a policy/license available.

Permissions	stream	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/stream	YES	If the material is suitable for streaming the right to 'Share' (which includes performance and communication to the public) and 'use' in any media or format implies the right to stream it for non-commercial purposes.
