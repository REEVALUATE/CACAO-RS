Section	Action	URI	Applicable	Reasoning
Permissions	accept tracking	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/acceptTracking	NO	The license does not explicitly grant or require the acceptance of tracking. It focuses on copyright permissions.
Permissions	aggregate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/aggregate	NO	The license allows sharing the material, which could be part of an aggregation, but 'aggregate' as a specific ODRL action (creating a collection) is not explicitly granted as a primary permission. The focus is on redistribution of the original, not necessarily creating new collections from it, though not prohibited if the work itself is unchanged. Given the NoDerivatives clause, aggregation must not create a derivative. The permission to share implies one could include it in a larger work, but the action 'aggregate' isn't a core granted right itself.
Permissions	annotate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/annotate	NO	Annotating could be seen as modifying the material. While private annotations wouldn't be an issue, distributing annotated material could be a derivative, which is prohibited. The license doesn't explicitly permit annotation for distribution.
Permissions	anonymize	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/anonymize	NO	Anonymizing data within the material would likely be considered a modification. If the material contains personal data, anonymizing it before sharing might be necessary under data protection laws, but the license itself doesn't grant this as a right over the copyrighted work. Distributing an anonymized version could be a derivative.
Permissions	archive	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/archive	YES	The permission to 'copy and redistribute' implies the right to make copies for archival purposes, as long as the terms (like attribution) are met and no derivatives are made. Archiving is a form of copying.
Permissions	attribute	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/attribute	NO	This action means to associate an assertion with the Asset. While the license *requires* attribution (an obligation), it does not *grant permission* to the licensee to make new assertions about the asset beyond what is required for attribution.
Permissions	attribution	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Attribution	NO	This is a condition/obligation of the license, not a permission granted to the licensee.
Permissions	commercial use	http://creativecommons.org/ns#CommercialUse	YES	The license explicitly states You are free to: Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.
Permissions	compensate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/compensate	NO	The license is royalty-free. There is no permission (or obligation) for the licensee to compensate the licensor.
Permissions	concurrent use	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/concurrentUse	YES	The license allows copying and redistributing, implying multiple users can use the material concurrently as per the license terms. There are no restrictions on the number of concurrent uses.
Permissions	delete	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/delete	NO	The license grants rights to use the material, not to delete the licensor's original or other legally held copies. A licensee can delete their own copies, but this isn't a permission granted *by the license* over the work itself.
Permissions	derivative works	http://creativecommons.org/ns#DerivativeWorks	NO	This is explicitly prohibited from being distributed. The license is NoDerivatives.
Permissions	derive	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/derive	NO	The license is NoDerivatives (ND), meaning if you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material. Thus, permission to derive for distribution is not granted. Private derivation is not restricted, but not explicitly permitted for sharing.
Permissions	digitize	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/digitize	YES	If the material is in analog form, digitizing it to copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format is permitted, provided it doesn't create a derivative (e.g., a simple format shift is okay).
Permissions	display	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/display	YES	Redistributing and sharing inherently include the right to display the material publicly or privately, as long as it's the original work and attribution is given.
Permissions	distribute	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/distribute	YES	The license explicitly states You are free to: Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format. This is equivalent to 'distribute'.
Permissions	distribution	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Distribution	YES	This is a core permission of the license. Share — copy and redistribute the material.
Permissions	ensure exclusivity	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/ensureExclusivity	NO	The license is non-exclusive. The licensor can grant licenses to others, and the licensee cannot claim exclusivity.
Permissions	execute	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/execute	YES	If the licensed material is software or a script, the permission to 'use' (implied by sharing and copying for any purpose) would include executing it, as long as this doesn't create/distribute a derivative.
Permissions	extract	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/extract	NO	Extracting parts of the work and using them in a way that creates a new work could be considered a derivative. If it's just extracting and redistributing a portion verbatim, it might be allowed under 'share', but the specific action 'extract' often implies use in a new context, which borders on derivative. Given ND, this is risky.
Permissions	give	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/give	YES	The permission to Share — copy and redistribute the material implies the right to give copies to others.
Permissions	grant use	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/grantUse	NO	The licensee cannot sublicense or grant use to others beyond the original license terms. They can share the work under the CC BY-ND 4.0 terms, but not grant a *new* or different use.
Permissions	include	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/include	NO	Including the work in a larger collection is generally allowed if the work itself is not modified. However, 'include' as an ODRL action can imply creating a new composite work, which might be seen as a derivative if the included work is adapted or tightly integrated. Sharing as part of a collection is fine, but specific 'include' rights are not explicitly granted beyond simple aggregation.
Permissions	index	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/index	NO	Indexing the material for private use is fine. Publicly distributing an index that itself contains substantial protected parts of the work or creates a new understanding might be a derivative. The license doesn't explicitly grant permission to create and distribute indexes as a separate right.
Permissions	inform	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/inform	NO	This action refers to informing a party. The license does not grant the licensee permission to inform others on behalf of the licensor or the work, other than providing the required notices.
Permissions	install	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/install	YES	If the material is software, the right to copy and use it (implied by for any purpose) includes installation on a device.
Permissions	modify	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/modify	NO	The license is NoDerivatives, which means modification for the purpose of distribution is prohibited. If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.
Permissions	move	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/move	YES	The licensee can move their copy of the material (e.g., from one storage device to another). This is inherent in the right to copy and use.
Permissions	next policy	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/nextPolicy	NO	The license does not grant the licensee the right to define or assign a next policy for the work. The work remains under CC BY-ND 4.0.
Permissions	notice	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Notice	NO	This is a condition/obligation for the licensee to provide notices, not a permission granted to them.
Permissions	obtain consent	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/obtainConsent	NO	The license doesn't grant the licensee the right to obtain consent from others regarding the work. Consent would typically be sought by the licensor or for uses outside the license.
Permissions	play	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/play	YES	If the material is audio or video, the right to share and use for any purpose includes the right to play it.
Permissions	present	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/present	YES	This is similar to 'display'. The right to share and use for any purpose includes presenting the work (e.g., in a slideshow, public performance of the unmodified work).
Permissions	print	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/print	YES	The right to copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format includes making print copies.
Permissions	read	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/read	YES	The right to copy and use the material inherently includes the right to read it.
Permissions	reproduce	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/reproduce	YES	The license explicitly states copy ... the material. Reproduce is synonymous with copy.
Permissions	reproduction	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Reproduction	YES	This is a core permission: copy and redistribute the material.
Permissions	review policy	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/reviewPolicy	NO	The license doesn't grant a specific permission to review a policy related to the asset. Anyone can review the CC BY-ND 4.0 license itself, but this is not a granted right over the asset.
Permissions	sell	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/sell	YES	The license allows use for any purpose, even commercially. This includes selling the original, unmodified work, as long as attribution is given and no derivatives are made. The act of selling is a form of redistribution.
Permissions	share Alike	http://creativecommons.org/ns#ShareAlike	NO	This is a CC BY-SA license feature, not CC BY-ND. This license does not require derivatives to be shared under the same terms, because it prohibits the distribution of derivatives.
Permissions	sharing	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Sharing	YES	This is the primary permission: Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.
Permissions	source code	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/sourceCode	NO	This Creative Commons license does not specifically mandate anything about source code, unlike some software licenses. If the licensed material is software and source code is provided, it can be shared under the same CC BY-ND terms. However, there is no explicit permission *related to demanding or providing* source code beyond what is shared by the licensor.
Permissions	stream	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/stream	YES	If the material can be streamed (e.g., audio/video), the right to share and use for any purpose would include streaming it, as long as it's the original work.
Permissions	synchronize	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/synchronize	NO	Synchronizing the material with another work (e.g., music with video) would likely create a derivative, which cannot be distributed.
Permissions	Text-to-speech	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/textToSpeech	NO	Generating speech from text might be considered creating an adaptation or derivative if the output is then distributed. Personal use is fine, but distribution of the TTS output as a representation of the work could be problematic under ND.
Permissions	transform	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/transform	NO	The license is NoDerivatives. Transformation for the purpose of distribution is prohibited. If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.
Permissions	translate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/translate	NO	A translation is considered a derivative work. Under CC BY-ND, you may not distribute translated versions of the material.
Permissions	uninstall	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/uninstall	NO	The license grants rights to use software (if applicable), not specific rights related to uninstalling it from the licensor's or other's systems. A user can uninstall their own copy, but this isn't a permission granted by the license regarding the work itself.
Permissions	use	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/use	YES	The phrase for any purpose in the context of sharing, copying, and redistributing implies a general permission to use the material, subject to the license conditions (attribution, no derivatives).
Permissions	watermark	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/watermark	NO	Adding a watermark would be a modification. Distributing a watermarked version would be distributing a derivative, which is prohibited.
Prohibitions	accept tracking	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/acceptTracking	NO	The license does not prohibit accepting tracking, nor does it address it.
Prohibitions	aggregate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/aggregate	NO	Aggregating the work with other works is not prohibited, as long as the work itself is not modified to create a derivative.
Prohibitions	annotate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/annotate	YES	Distributing an annotated version of the work is prohibited if the annotation is considered a modification/derivative. If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.
Prohibitions	anonymize	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/anonymize	YES	Distributing an anonymized version of the work is prohibited if anonymization is considered a modification/derivative.
Prohibitions	archive	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/archive	NO	Archiving (making a copy for preservation) is not prohibited, it's a form of copying.
Prohibitions	attribute	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/attribute	NO	The license does not prohibit associating an assertion with the asset, though it requires specific attribution. False attribution could be an issue outside the license.
Prohibitions	attribution	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Attribution	NO	Failing to provide attribution is a violation of a condition, making the use unlicensed, rather than a direct prohibition of an action *called* 'attribution'. The license prohibits using the work *without* attribution.
Prohibitions	commercial use	http://creativecommons.org/ns#CommercialUse	NO	Commercial use is explicitly permitted.
Prohibitions	compensate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/compensate	NO	The license does not prohibit compensation (e.g., if someone wanted to voluntarily compensate the licensor), but it doesn't require it.
Prohibitions	concurrent use	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/concurrentUse	NO	Concurrent use is not prohibited.
Prohibitions	delete	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/delete	NO	The license does not prohibit a user from deleting their own copy. It doesn't address deleting others' copies or the original.

Prohibitions	execute	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/execute	NO	Executing the work (if applicable) is not prohibited.
Prohibitions	extract	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/extract	YES	If extracting and redistributing constitutes a derivative, then it is prohibited. Simply quoting or using excerpts as allowed by copyright exceptions (fair use) is not prohibited by the license. However, extracting to create a modified version for distribution is.
Prohibitions	give	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/give	NO	Giving the work to others (sharing) is permitted.
Prohibitions	grant use	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/grantUse	YES	The licensee cannot grant new or different uses/licenses for the material. They can only pass on the rights they received under CC BY-ND 4.0 by sharing the work. NoSublicense is stated in Section 2.a.1.
Prohibitions	include	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/include	YES	If including the work in another results in a derivative work that is then distributed, it is prohibited. Simply collecting works is not prohibited.
