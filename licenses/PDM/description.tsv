Public Domain Mark 1.0 Universal	PDM	The Public Domain Mark (PDM) is a tool that allows anyone to mark and tag a work that is free of known copyright restrictions worldwide, all in a way that clearly communicates that status to the public and allows it to be easily discoverable. The PDM is not a legal instrument like CC0 or Creative Commons licenses there is no accompanying legal code or agreement. It should only be used to label a work that is already free of known copyright restrictions around the world. When a work is marked with PDM, it signifies that you can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission under copyright law.	https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/deed.en
