Section	Action	URI	Applicable	Reasoning
Permissions	accept tracking	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/acceptTracking	NO	The PDM relates to copyright status of a work, not typically to interactions with services that might involve tracking. Whether a user accepts tracking is independent of the public domain status of the content being accessed.
Permissions	aggregate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/aggregate	YES	A work in the public domain can be aggregated with other works without copyright restriction.
Permissions	annotate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/annotate	YES	A work in the public domain can be annotated (e.g., adding notes or commentary) without copyright restriction.
Permissions	anonymize	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/anonymize	YES	If the work contains personal data, and one has the right to process it, anonymizing it is a form of modification/use, permissible for a public domain work. The PDM itself doesn't govern data protection, but doesn't restrict this act on the content.
Permissions	archive	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/archive	YES	A work in the public domain can be archived without copyright restriction.
Permissions	attribute	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/attribute	YES	While PDM itself doesn't mandate attribution (unlike some CC licenses), the act of attributing is not restricted. Moral rights may still apply in some jurisdictions, making attribution appropriate or required by other laws, but from a copyright permission standpoint under PDM, one *can* attribute.
Permissions	attribution	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Attribution	NO	PDM signifies public domain, which means no copyright conditions like mandatory attribution are imposed by the mark itself. While good practice, it's not a permission granted *by* PDM as a condition, but an inherent freedom.
Permissions	commercial use	http://creativecommons.org/ns#CommercialUse	YES	Works in the public domain can be used for commercial purposes without copyright restriction.
Permissions	compensate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/compensate	NO	The PDM indicates a work is free of copyright restriction there is no requirement or mechanism for compensation related to the copyright status. This action is usually a duty, not a permission granted to the user.
Permissions	concurrent use	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/concurrentUse	YES	There are no copyright restrictions on how many people can use a public domain work simultaneously.
Permissions	delete	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/delete	YES	A user who has a copy of a public domain work can delete their copy. This refers to the user's copy, not the original or other copies.

Permissions	derive	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/derive	YES	A work in the public domain can be used to derive new works without copyright restriction.

Permissions	ensure exclusivity	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/ensureExclusivity	NO	The nature of public domain is non-exclusive. One cannot ensure exclusivity for a public domain work based on copyright.
Permissions	execute	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/execute	YES	If the public domain work is software or a program, it can be executed without copyright restriction.

Permissions	give	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/give	YES	A copy of a public domain work can be given to others without copyright restriction.
Permissions	grant use	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/grantUse	NO	An individual user cannot 'grant use' for a public domain work as if they are the rightsholder, because there are no copyright restrictions to grant. The work is already free for all to use.

Permissions	index	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/index	YES	A public domain work can be indexed (e.g., by a search engine or for a database) without copyright restriction.

Permissions	notice	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Notice	NO	PDM signifies public domain, which means no copyright conditions like requiring notices are imposed by the mark itself for the use of the work.
Permissions	obtain consent	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/obtainConsent	NO	Consent is not needed for using a public domain work from a copyright perspective. This action is usually for data privacy contexts.

Permissions	reproduction	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Reproduction	YES	Synonymous with 'reproduce'. Works in the public domain can be reproduced.
Permissions	review policy	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/reviewPolicy	NO	The PDM is not a policy to be reviewed by the user in terms of their use rights it's a statement about the work's status.
Permissions	sell	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/sell	YES	A public domain work, or copies of it, can be sold. The copyright status does not prevent selling the work or a product incorporating it.
Permissions	share Alike	http://creativecommons.org/ns#ShareAlike	NO	PDM signifies public domain. There is no ShareAlike condition, as that is a specific license term for copyrighted works.

Permissions	source code	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/sourceCode	YES	If the PDM work is software and source code is available, it can be accessed and used. The PDM itself doesn't mandate providing source code, but using available source code of a PD program is permitted.

Permissions	watermark	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/watermark	NO	While one *could* add a watermark to their copy of a public domain work, this action usually implies a restriction or a claim being asserted, which is contrary to the nature of public domain. PDM doesn't grant a 'permission' to watermark in a rights sense, but doesn't prevent one from modifying their copy. However, misleadingly implying copyright by a watermark would be problematic.
Prohibitions	accept tracking	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/acceptTracking	NO	PDM does not prohibit accepting tracking. This is user choice, unrelated to copyright status.
Prohibitions	aggregate	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/aggregate	NO	PDM does not prohibit aggregation. Works are free to be aggregated.

Prohibitions	distribution	http://creativecommons.org/ns#Distribution	NO	PDM does not prohibit distribution.
Prohibitions	ensure exclusivity	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/ensureExclusivity	YES	While PDM itself doesn't prohibit this action, the nature of public domain means one *cannot* ensure exclusivity based on copyright. So, attempting to assert copyright exclusivity over a PD work is effectively prohibited by the work's actual status. The action of ensuring exclusivity is counter to what PDM represents.

Prohibitions	watermark	http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/watermark	NO	PDM does not prohibit a user from adding a watermark to their own copy.
